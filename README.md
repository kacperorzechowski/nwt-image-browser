# NWT Image Browser
## The project
NWT Image Browser uses API provided by NWT Data Provider to let user browse images from Giphy and Pixabay. It has list and search function. 
As user you are able to type phrase you want to search for and App will return the content you are looking for.
## Struggles
* webpack config - well this is quite tough part. It was my first time creating very own webpack configuration. I have skipped production configuration to save some time.
